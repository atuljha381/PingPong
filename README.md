# PingPong
This is a pong which I made by using Kivy library which is an open source library to create Apps which can be used on Android devices as well
You can go to the given link to download Kivy library 
https://kivy.org/#download
If you have Anaconda integrated to your IDE you can opt for the Anaconda installation as it is more quicker and requires only one command line to install
   conda install kivy -c conda-forge. 
Else install it corresponding to your Operating System

Personally, I used Pycharm to make the game.
